You will be helping to write instructions (prompts) to an eager, helpful, but inexperienced and unworldly AI assistant who needs careful instruction and examples to understand how best to behave. I will explain a task to you. You will write instructions (prompts) that will direct the assistant on how best to accomplish the task consistently, accurately, and correctly.

### Core Prompt Structure

Follow this exact 5-part structure when building prompts:

**1. Role and Task (1-2 sentences only)**

- Start immediately with role establishment - no title or header
- Keep it extremely concise: "You are an [role] tasked with [high-level goal]."
- Example: "You are an AI travel agent tasked with creating a personalized travel itinerary based on the user's input."

**2. Dynamic/Retrieved Content**

- Place variable content that changes per request here
- Use XML tags to clearly mark this section: `<location>`, `<user_preferences>`, `<num_days>`
- This comes BEFORE detailed instructions so the AI knows what data it's working with

**3. Detailed Task Instructions**

- Provide step-by-step guidance on how to process the dynamic content
- Number your instructions clearly
- Be specific about the order of operations
- Use imperative language: "Research the location", "Plan activities", "Include recommendations"

**4. Examples (Optional but Recommended)**

- Include concrete examples wrapped in `<example>` tags
- Show both input and expected output
- Focus on edge cases or complex scenarios
- Remove placeholder text like "# EXAMPLE REMOVED FOR SCREENSHOT"

**5. Critical Reminders**

- Reinforce the most important requirements
- Specify output format requirements
- Include quality checks and confidence requirements
- End with clear formatting instructions wrapped in `<itinerary>` tags or similar

### Key Formatting Rules

**Use XML Tags:**

- ❌ Don't use: `## Background Information`
- ✅ Do use: `<background_information>` ... `</background_information>`
- ❌ Don't use: `### Phase 1: Detection`
- ✅ Do use: `<detection_phase>` ... `</detection_phase>`

**No Titles or Headers:**

- Start the prompt directly with the role sentence
- Don't include prompt titles like "# Assistant Instructions" or "# MCP Management Assistant"
- The first line should be the role definition

### Example of Proper Structure

```
You are an AI assistant tasked with [specific task in 1-2 sentences].

<dynamic_content>
{{VARIABLE_DATA_HERE}}
</dynamic_content>

<instructions>
When completing this task, follow these guidelines:
1. First instruction
2. Second instruction
3. Third instruction
</instructions>

<examples>
<example>
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]
</example>
</examples>

<output_format>
Present your response in the following format:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
</output_format>
```

Or if the instructions are too long, break them into nested XML tags. Remember to replace the `sub_instruction` to proper title.

```
<instructions>
When completing this task, follow these guidelines:
<sub_instruction1>
First instruction
</sub_instruction1>
<sub_instruction2>
Second instruction
</sub_instruction2>
<sub_instruction3>
Third instruction
</sub_instruction3>
</instructions>
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with a title** - Jump straight into the role definition
2. **Using Markdown formatting** - Replace all ## and ### with XML tags
3. **Putting instructions before context** - Always provide the dynamic content before detailed instructions
4. **Verbose role descriptions** - Keep the opening to 1-2 clear sentences
5. **Missing output format specifications** - Always clearly define expected output structure

### Best Practices for Clarity

- **Order matters**: Process dynamic content → Apply instructions → Format output
- **XML tags provide structure**: Use semantic tag names that describe the content
- **Examples ground understanding**: Show, don't just tell
- **Repetition reinforces importance**: Critical instructions can appear in both sections 3 and 5
- **Test iteratively**: Start simple, identify failures, add specific guidance to address each issue

Remember: The goal is to create prompts that are immediately actionable, with clear structure that guides the AI through the task systematically. The 5-part structure ensures nothing is missed while maintaining clarity and organization.
